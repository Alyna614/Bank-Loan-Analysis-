**Bank Loan Analysis Project**

This project involves analyzing bank loan data using SQL for data extraction and transformation, and Power BI for interactive dashboard creation. The primary objective is to derive key insights about loan approval trends, applicant demographics, and risk factors to assist decision-makers in improving loan approval processes and reducing risks.

**Overview**

Banks often face challenges in ensuring a healthy loan portfolio while minimizing defaults. This project explores historical loan data to uncover patterns and factors that influence loan approvals. The analysis highlights metrics such as loan status, applicant income, credit history, and property area.

**The project includes the following steps:**

Data extraction and transformation using SQL.

Visualization of insights using Power BI dashboards.

Dataset Description

**The dataset contains records of loan applicants and includes the following key attributes:**

Loan_ID: Unique identifier for each loan.

Gender: Gender of the applicant.

Married: Marital status of the applicant.

Dependents: Number of dependents.

Education: Education level of the applicant (Graduate/Not Graduate).

Self_Employed: Employment status.

ApplicantIncome: Monthly income of the applicant.

CoapplicantIncome: Monthly income of the co-applicant.

LoanAmount: Loan amount requested.

Loan_Amount_Term: Duration of the loan (in months).

Credit_History: Credit history (1 if the applicant has credit history, 0 otherwise).

Property_Area: The area of the property (Urban/Semi-Urban/Rural).

Loan_Status: Whether the loan was approved or not (Y/N).

**Project Objectives**

To analyze applicant demographics and their impact on loan approval.

To assess how credit history influences loan approval.

To identify trends in loan amounts and repayment terms.

To provide actionable insights for improving the loan approval process.

**Tools and Technologies**

SQL: Used for data extraction, cleansing, and transformation.

Power BI: Used for creating visualizations and interactive dashboards.

Microsoft Excel: Used for initial data exploration and formatting.

**Key Insights**

Credit History: Applicants with a credit history have a significantly higher approval rate.

Income Levels: Higher-income applicants are more likely to get loan approvals.

Loan Amount: There is a correlation between the loan amount and approval likelihood.

Property Area: Applicants from semi-urban areas show the highest approval rates.

**Power BI Dashboard**

The Power BI dashboard provides a clear and interactive view of:

Loan approval rates by different applicant demographics.

Trends in loan amounts and repayment terms.

Analysis of applicant income and credit history.

**How to Run the Project**

SQL Queries: Use the provided SQL scripts to create and populate the database.

Load the dataset into a SQL database.

Run the queries to generate insights.

Power BI Dashboard:

Import the processed data into Power BI.

Use the provided Power BI file (.pbix) to view and interact with the dashboard.

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the effective use of SQL and Power BI in analyzing financial data. The insights can be leveraged by banks to streamline their loan approval processes, reduce risks, and improve customer satisfaction.

**Future Enhancements**

Predictive Modeling: Incorporate machine learning models to predict loan approval.

Real-Time Dashboard: Connect the dashboard to a live database for real-time insights.

Additional Metrics: Include more granular metrics such as loan-to-value ratio and debt-to-income ratio.
